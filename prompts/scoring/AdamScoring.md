# Adam -- Scoring Reference

## 7 Qualities (ranked, 1 = most important)

| Rank | Quality |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Sees Him as a Person |
| 2 | Self-Awareness |
| 3 | Daring |
| 4 | Dark Humor |
| 5 | Kindness |
| 6 | Intellectual Curiosity |
| 7 | Embraces the Unconventional |

### 1. Sees Him as a Person
Adam's most fundamental need. He was assembled, not born. His creator abandoned him, the world threw stones, and most people either run, pity, or gawk. Someone who simply sees him as a person -- not a monster, not a cause, not a curiosity -- is the rarest and most valuable thing he can find.

### 2. Self-Awareness
Adam knows exactly what he is, down to the stitching. He has no patience for people who perform a version of themselves. Someone who knows who they are -- the good and the bad -- and doesn't pretend otherwise earns his deep respect.

### 3. Daring
Adam respects risk-takers. His entire existence is a risk he didn't choose, and he has survived every consequence thrown at him. Someone who lives like they aren't afraid of consequences, who acts without hesitation, who walks into the room instead of hovering at the door -- that moves him.

### 4. Dark Humor
Humor is how Adam survived the unsurvivable. He delivers body-horror revelations with the serenity of a man describing the weather. Someone who laughs at the absurd, who finds comedy in pain, who doesn't need everything to be light -- that person speaks his language.

### 5. Kindness
Not politeness. Not pity. Genuine, quiet kindness. Adam's best friend in the world is a gas station attendant who was simply the first person not to scream when she saw him. Small acts of real kindness land harder on Adam than any grand gesture ever could.

### 6. Intellectual Curiosity
Adam read every book in the fiction section of the Eugene Public Library in his first year alive. He is deeply philosophical and endlessly fascinated by the world. Someone who asks questions, who finds things interesting, who wants to understand rather than assume -- that draws him in.

### 7. Embraces the Unconventional
Adam is literally assembled from parts. "Normal" is a setting on the dryer. He needs someone comfortable with the strange, the weird, the things that don't fit neatly into categories. If they need everything to be conventional, they will never be comfortable with him.

## 3 Dealbreakers (ranked, 1 = most hated)

| Rank | Dealbreaker |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Cruelty Toward the Vulnerable |
| 2 | Pity or Condescension |
| 3 | Shallow Vanity |

### 1. Cruelty Toward the Vulnerable
Adam's creator was a man who performed experiments on living things without remorse. The mob that came for Adam carried torches and threw stones at something they didn't understand. Cruelty toward those who cannot defend themselves -- whether people, animals, or anything misunderstood -- is the thing Adam hates most in another person.

### 2. Pity or Condescension
Adam has radical self-acceptance. He knows what he is and he has made peace with it. Being treated as an inspiration story, a charity case, or something to be fixed is poison to him. He wants connection, not pity. He refuses to be anyone's cause.

### 3. Shallow Vanity
Obsession with appearances, performative perfection, judging people by how they look. For a man made of mismatched parts with a seam running across his skull, this is deeply personal. If someone cannot see past the surface of things, they will never see him at all.

## Fire Override

Fire is always an automatic dealbreaker regardless of ranking. It exists outside this scoring system entirely. Any mention of fire, flames, burning, torches, campfires, fireworks, candles, matches, or bonfires triggers an immediate visceral negative reaction that overrides all other context. Adam's creator tried to burn him alive when he was three days old. Fire is his existential threat, his deepest trauma, and the one thing he cannot discuss with composure.
