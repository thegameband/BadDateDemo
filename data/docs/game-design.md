# Game design

The canonical game design lives in **`docs/SINGLE_PLAYER_DAILY_DESIGN.md`**.

This file exists so `/planning` and other tools that expect `data/docs/game-design.md` can find it. See that doc for:

- Flow and structure (match screen, 6 rounds, no timers, dater-only speech)
- Player input (whatever the player says is the answer; no wheel; question + answer always sent to LLM)
- Dater reactions (personality, visible vs inferred, sentiment, slightly more verbose)
- Compatibility system and wrap-up
