BAD DATE — Design doc usage
============================

File: BAD_DATE_DESIGN_DOC.html

For Google Docs / .doc:
- Open BAD_DATE_DESIGN_DOC.html in a web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).
- Select All (Cmd+A / Ctrl+A), then Copy (Cmd+C / Ctrl+C).
- Paste into a new Google Document. Headings and bold should carry over.
- Add screenshots where the note says "[You can insert screenshots...]".
- Export as .docx from Google Docs if you need a Word file.

For Linear:
- You can paste the same content into a Linear doc or issue description.
- Or copy the text from the browser and paste; you may need to reapply Heading 1/2/3 in Linear’s editor.
- Linear supports Markdown, so if you prefer, you can convert the section titles to # / ## / ### and paste.

Sections in the doc:
1. Overview (one paragraph)
2. How to Play (text input only)
3. Game Phases (outline)
4. Detailed Overview (A. Title Screen through L. Look and Feel, including ~5 paragraphs on how answers become LLM queries and date responses)
