<h1>Bad Date — Game Design Document</h1>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<p>Bad Date is a single-player dating game where the player goes on a blind date with an AI-powered character. The entire experience is driven by freeform text input: the player types whatever they want, and the date responds in real time with a personality, opinions, and feelings that evolve over the course of the conversation. There are no right answers, no multiple-choice menus, and no timers. The fun comes from seeing how a fully realized character reacts to whatever you throw at them — whether that's sincere, absurd, romantic, or deeply unsettling.</p>

<p>The game is built around a simple loop: the game asks a question, the player types an answer, and the date reacts. Behind the scenes, an LLM generates every response using the date's complete personality profile, hidden values, and the running history of the conversation. A compatibility score tracks how well the date is going, updated after every reaction, and at the end the player receives a final score along with a highlight reel of the best and worst moments.</p>

<p>A typical session will last roughly ten minutes. The structure is as follows: the player meets their date, answers a few questions about themselves, plays through six rounds of questions and reactions, navigates a mid-date Plot Twist, and then sees how the whole thing shook out. The experience is designed to be replayable and mobile-first. Different answers produce genuinely different reactions — and mobile-first, so the entire game can be played with a phone keyboard and a bit of imagination.</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>A note on terminology:</strong> Throughout this document, the <strong>Avatar</strong> refers to the player's character — the person the player creates at the start of the date. The <strong>Dater</strong> refers to the AI character the player is going on a date with. The Avatar is defined by the player's answers; the Dater is a pre-built character with a deep personality, backstory, values, and hidden preferences that drive every reaction in the game.
</div>

<h2>2. How to Play</h2>

<p>Bad Date will be played <strong>exclusively through text input</strong>. From the moment the player leaves the title screen, every meaningful choice in the game is something they type. There are no dialogue trees, no multiple-choice prompts, and no button-based responses. The player's keyboard is their only tool, and whatever they type becomes canon for that date. This design choice is deliberate: it gives the player complete creative freedom and makes every date feel unpredictable, because the AI has to respond to whatever the player actually said rather than choosing from a set of pre-written options.</p>

<p>During the date itself, the player will see the current question, a single text input field, and a submit button. They can type a single word, a full sentence, or something completely unexpected, the system will accept it. After submitting, the player's answer will appear in a small oval beneath the question, and then the Dater will respond. There is no chat log or scrolling message history; the screen shows only the current question and the Dater's most recent reaction. This keeps the focus tight and conversational, like actually being on a date where you're paying attention to the person in front of you.</p>

<p>There are three moments where the player types beyond the standard question-and-answer rounds. First, during <strong>Who Are You?</strong>, the player will answer three questions about their character (appearance, mood, and name). Second, during the <strong>Plot Twist</strong>, the player will type how they'd handle a surprise scenario. Third, if the Dater has a strongly negative reaction, a <strong>Justify</strong> screen will appear: a full-screen takeover asking the player to explain themselves in one more typed response. In every case, the mechanic is the same: type whatever you want and see what happens.</p>

<p>The game has no timers. The player can take as long as they want to think about their answer, and the game will not advance until the Dater's full reaction (including voice-over, if enabled) has finished playing. Progression is entirely turn-based: the player acts, the Dater reacts, and then the next round begins. This pacing is intentional. It lets the player read and absorb the Dater's response before moving on, which is especially important given how specific and personality-driven those responses will be.</p>

<h2>3. Game Phases</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title Screen</strong> — Main menu with a single <strong>Play Now</strong> button. No name entry required.</li>
  <li><strong>Today's Dater</strong> — The player sees today's date: portrait, name, age, gender, occupation, and hobbies.</li>
  <li><strong>Who Are You?</strong> — 3 questions are asked, in order: "How do you look?", "How are you feeling?", "What is your name?" The player answers each with freeform text. No timer.</li>
  <li><strong>First Impression</strong> — The Dater opens the date by reacting to the Avatar's appearance, name, and emotional state. Two spoken comments: a gut reaction and a prediction about how the date will go. Only the Dater speaks.</li>
  <li><strong>The Date</strong> — For each of 6 rounds: the game shows a question, the player types and submits an answer, and the Dater responds with two comments.</li>
  <li><strong>Plot Twist</strong> — After Round 3, a Plot Twist interrupts before Round 4 continues. The game asks, "Another person hit on your date! What do you do?" The player types a response. The game generates a short "What Happened" narrative, and the Dater reacts.</li>
  <li><strong>Wrap Up</strong> — The Dater sums up how the date went and shares their final impression.</li>
  <li><strong>Date Review</strong> — A highlight reel: short sentences summarizing the best and worst moments and what the Dater thought of them.</li>
  <li><strong>Score</strong> — The final compatibility percentage (0–100) is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Detailed Overview</h2>

<h3>A. Title Screen</h3>

<p>When the player opens the game, they will land on a clean, minimal title screen. The primary action is a single <strong>Play Now</strong> button, prominently placed, that launches the game immediately. There is no name entry field, no account creation, and no login. The goal is to get the player into a date as quickly as possible with zero friction.</p>

<h3>B. Today's Dater</h3>

<p>After tapping Play Now, the player is taken directly to <strong>Today's Dater</strong>. This is their first look at the character they're about to go on a date with. The screen will display the Dater's portrait image, their name, age, gender, occupation, and a handful of hobbies or interests. All of this information is pulled from the Dater's personality profile. A narrator will announce the Dater by name ("Your date today is Maya"), giving the moment a bit of ceremony.</p>

<p>The purpose of this screen is to build anticipation and give the player just enough information to form a first impression. They'll know what their date looks like, what they do for a living, and what they're into, but they won't know the Dater's hidden values, dealbreakers, or personality quirks. Those will reveal themselves organically through the date itself. The screen has one action: a <strong>START THE DATE</strong> button.</p>

<h3>C. Who Are You?</h3>

<p>Once the player taps START THE DATE, the game transitions into a brief character-creation sequence. Rather than a traditional avatar builder with sliders and presets, Bad Date will ask the player three open-ended questions about the person they're bringing to the date. The questions are always the same and always in the same order: <strong>"How do you look?"</strong>, <strong>"How are you feeling?"</strong>, and <strong>"What is your name?"</strong> Each answer is a single freeform text input — the player can type anything from "tall with glasses" to "a sentient cloud of bees" and the game will accept it.</p>

<p>These answers directly shape how the Dater perceives the Avatar for the rest of the game. The first answer becomes the Avatar's physical description, and the Dater will "see" this during their first impression. If the player says they look like a pirate, the Dater will react to a pirate. The second answer becomes the Avatar's emotional state, which the Dater may reference more subtly. The third answer is what the Dater will call the player throughout the date. Together, these three answers give the AI everything it needs to treat the Avatar as a specific person with a look, a vibe, and a name.</p>

<p>After the third answer is submitted, the game has all the Avatar data it needs. The transition into the date is immediate: the screen shifts to the date view, and the Dater delivers their first impressions.</p>

<h3>D. First Impressions</h3>

<p>The date begins with the First Impression — the Dater's initial reaction to seeing the Avatar for the first time. The AI is given the Avatar's physical description and name as primary inputs. Using this information plus the Dater's full personality profile, the AI generates the first of two spoken comments that set the tone for the entire date.</p>

<p>The <strong>first comment</strong> is the Dater's immediate, unfiltered gut reaction to the Avatar's <strong>appearance</strong>. If the player described themselves as "covered in tattoos with a leather jacket," the Dater might be intrigued, intimidated, or attracted — depending entirely on who they are as a character. This comment is purely about what the Dater sees when the Avatar walks in. The <strong>second comment</strong> takes in the full picture: the Avatar's appearance <strong>and</strong> their emotional state. The Dater states their overall first impression of this person and makes a quick prediction about how the date might go — something like "I have a feeling this is going to be interesting" or "Something tells me I should have stayed home." Both comments are spoken by the Dater directly to the Avatar. The Avatar does not speak during First Impressions.</p>

<h3>E. Date Rounds 1–6 (Questions and Answers)</h3>

<p>After First Impressions, the game enters its main loop: 6 rounds of questions and answers that determine whether your dater is compatible with you. Each round follows the same rhythm. The game will display a Date Question on screen. Questions are drawn from a curated pool created by the Design team, and cover a range of hot topics: guilty pleasures, controversial opinions, deal-makers and deal-breakers, hypothetical scenarios, and personal revelations.</p>

<p>Once the player submits their answer, it appears in a small oval beneath the question so they can see what they wrote. Simultaneously, two things happen in parallel: a narrator reads the player's answer aloud (so the player hears their own words spoken back), and behind the scenes the game begins generating the Dater's response. This overlap is intentional — it fills the brief generation time with something the player can listen to, so there's no dead air.</p>

<p>When the Dater's response is ready, they will deliver two separate comments, each spoken aloud and displayed as text. Each comment displays in a single dialogue bubble. The first comment is the Dater's immediate gut reaction, their honest, in-character response to what the player just said, tested against their personality, values, and preferences.</p>

<p>The second comment goes deeper: the Dater will look for one thing the player said earlier in the date that naturally connects to the current answer. If a genuine connection exists ("Wait, earlier you said you love animals, and now you're telling me this?"), they'll mention it. If nothing connects, they won't force it, they'll simply share more of their opinion about the current answer. Both comments are two-sentences each, keeping the dialogue punchy and opinionated.</p>

<p>After both comments finish, a reaction tag appears on screen: a brief label showing a concise description of what the dater thought of the player's answer. This description will be tied to one of the dater's Personality Attributes: a set of attributes created by the LLM based on the dater's personality profile. These attributes are organized into 4 categories: Loves, Likes, Dislikes, and Dealbreakers.</p>

<p>This loop repeats for six rounds. After Round 3, a Plot Twist interrupts the flow (see below), and after Round 6 the game transitions into the Wrap Up. The player is never rushed — there are no timers on any input, and the game won't advance until the Dater's full reaction has finished playing. The pacing is meant to feel like an actual conversation: speak, listen, react, pause, next topic.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. How Your Answers Become the Date's Reactions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: The Player's Answer Meets the Question</h3>

<p>When the player types an answer and hits submit, the very first thing the game does is pair that answer with the question that was asked. This might sound obvious, but it's a critical step. If the question was "What's your guilty pleasure?" and the player typed "Cheese," the system doesn't just send "Cheese" to the AI — it sends the full context: <em>the question was "What's your guilty pleasure?" and the player answered "Cheese."</em> This pairing ensures that the Dater always understands what the player was responding to, even if the answer is a single word or something cryptic. Without this context, "Cheese" could mean anything; with it, the Dater knows it's a guilty pleasure and can react accordingly.</p>

<p>Along with the question-and-answer pair, the game also attaches the <strong>conversation history</strong> — a running log of what the player and Dater have said so far. This means the Dater can reference earlier moments in the date ("Wait, you also said you hate mornings — this is starting to make sense"). The history is trimmed to the most recent exchanges to keep things manageable, but it's always present, so the Dater's responses can build on the conversation rather than treating each answer in isolation.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Building the Dater's "Brain" — The Personality Prompt</h3>

<p>Before the AI can generate a response, the game needs to tell it <em>who the Dater is</em>. This is done through a detailed instruction set — think of it as a briefing that describes the Dater's entire personality. Every Dater in the game has a rich character profile: their backstory, values, beliefs, sense of humor, communication style, what they find attractive, and what they absolutely cannot stand. The game compiles all of this into a single set of instructions that essentially says: "You are Maya. Here is who you are, what you believe, how you talk, and what matters to you. Now react to what this person just said."</p>

<p>The personality prompt also includes behavioral rules: things the Dater should always or never do. For instance, the Dater is instructed to always speak in dialogue (no narration or stage directions), to always have a clear opinion (never just saying "that's interesting"), and to keep each comment to exactly two sentences. These rules ensure that no matter what the player says, the Dater's response feels like something a real person would say on a date: opinionated, concise, and emotionally honest. The Dater can be charmed, repulsed, excited, confused, or scared, but they can never be bland.</p>

<p>On top of the base personality, the game layers in <strong>context-specific instructions</strong> based on what the player said. If the player's answer describes something physical, like, "I'm seven feet tall" or "I have a third arm", the system tells the Dater to treat it as something they can literally see, and to react with heightened intensity. If the answer is more abstract like, "I value honesty above everything," the system tells the Dater to infer what the player means and react based on their own values and perspective. This distinction between "visible" and "inferred" content keeps the Dater's reactions grounded: they react to what they'd actually notice on a date.</p>

<h3>Step 3: The AI Generates a Response</h3>

<p>With the question, the answer, the conversation history, and the full personality prompt assembled, the game sends everything to the AI (a large language model). The AI's job is straightforward: read the instructions, get into character, and generate the Dater's spoken response to what the player just said. The response comes back as pure dialogue: two sentences that the Dater would actually say out loud on this date.</p>

<p>The game generates two separate responses for each player answer. The first is the Dater's immediate gut reaction: their honest, unfiltered first thought. The second is a follow-up where the Dater either connects the current answer to something the player said earlier (if a genuine connection exists) or simply shares more of their own opinion. Each response is generated independently, which allows the Dater to shift tone between comments.</p>

<p>Before either comment is shown to the player, the game cleans up the text. Any stray action descriptions (like "*laughs nervously*") are stripped out, since the Dater is supposed to express emotion through words alone. The cleaned text is then displayed on screen and, if text-to-speech is enabled, spoken aloud in the Dater's voice. The result is a response that feels spontaneous and personal, as if the Dater is actually sitting across from the player, hearing what they said, and reacting in the moment.</p>

<h3>Step 4: How the Game Knows If the Dater Liked An Answer</h3>

<p>While the player sees the Dater's spoken reaction, something else is happening behind the scenes: the game is figuring out how the Dater felt about what was said. Every Dater has a set of <strong>Personality Attributes</strong>: things they love, things they like, things they dislike, and things that are absolute dealbreakers. The player never sees these attributes directly, but they drive the mechanical side of the game.</p>

<p>After the Dater's response is generated, the game asks the AI to do a quick self-assessment: based on the reaction it just gave, how did the Dater actually feel? The system uses a four-tier rating scale: <strong>Great, Good, Bad,</strong> or <strong>Awful</strong>, and requires the AI to pick a specific trait from the Dater's Personality Attributes that justifies the rating. So if the Dater reacted enthusiastically, the system might rate it "Great" and connect it to a "Love" attribute like "creativity." If the Dater reacted with visible discomfort, it might rate it "Bad" and connect it to a "Dislike" attribute like "recklessness." The rating always matches the tone of the spoken reaction, which keeps the mechanical outcome aligned with what the player actually heard.</p>

<p>This rating is then translated into a <strong>compatibility score change</strong>. A "Great" (Love) reaction raises the meter by 20 points; a "Good" (Like) gives a 5-point boost; "Bad" (Dislike) lowers it by 5; and "Awful" (Dealbreaker) drops it by 20. These changes accumulate over the course of the date on a single compatibility meter that runs from 0 to 100. The player sees the overall compatibility percentage at the end, along with a breakdown of what went well and what didn't — but during the date, the only feedback they get is the Dater's words and the reaction tag that appears on the second comment.</p>

<h3>Step 5: When Things Go Really Wrong — The Justify Mechanic</h3>

<p>If the Dater rates their own reaction as "Awful", meaning the player hit a dealbreaker, the game may trigger a special <strong>Justify</strong> moment. Instead of moving to the next question, the screen is taken over by a full-screen prompt that says <strong>"Justify Your Answer."</strong> The player gets one chance to type an explanation: why did they say what they said? What did they actually mean? The Dater then responds to the justification with a follow-up reaction, which can soften the blow, make it worse, or land somewhere in between. After that, the round is complete and the date continues.</p>

<p>The Justify mechanic serves two purposes. First, it creates a dramatic moment, the date has gone sideways, and the player has to think on their feet. Second, it gives the AI a chance to generate a more nuanced reaction: the Dater isn't just reacting to the original answer anymore, they're reacting to the explanation, the original answer, and their own first reaction all at once.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. The Compatibility System</h2>

<p>Behind every date in Bad Date, there will be a compatibility system that quietly tracks how well things are going. The player won't see the raw numbers during the date, they'll only feel it through the Dater's tone, their body language in the 3D scene, and the reaction tags that appear after each response. But under the hood, each reaction either gains the player points, or causes them to lose them, from the Compatibility Meter.</p>

<p>Every answer the player gives is sorted into 1 of 4 categories: <strong>Love</strong>, <strong>Like</strong>, <strong>Dislike</strong>, or <strong>Dealbreaker</strong>. For every answer that the player Loves, the compatibility meter rises by <strong>20%</strong>. For each Like, it increases by <strong>5%</strong>, each Dislike drops the meter by <strong>5%</strong>, while hitting a Dealbreaker drops <strong>20%</strong> from the meter.</p>

<p>Complicating things is the fact that the current state of the Compatibility Meter influences whether the dater interprets an answer, slightly, especially when it is between a like/dislike. In the case where the reaction could go either way, as in a positive and a negative attribute are hit (say in a case where the player mentions that they love skydiving, and the Dater loves flying, but hates extreme sports), the game should reference the current compatibility meter in order to see which way to react, and which attribute to tie to the answer. If the compatibility meter is currently above 50%, it should go with the Like, if it's below 50%, it should go with the dislike. If it's an even 50%, it should flip a coin, digitally, that is.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current state of the compatibility shouldn't play into an answer that is either loved, or is a dealbreaker. Those attributes should override the compatibility meter.</p>

<h2>7. Plot Twist</h2>

<p>After the Dater's response to <strong>Round 3</strong>, the game will insert a narrative interruption called the <strong>Plot Twist</strong>. The date pauses, and the player sees a dramatic interstitial: "Another person just hit on your date! What do you do?" A text input appears, and the player types their response. They can type anything from "politely ask them to leave" to "challenge them to a dance-off" to "pretend I don't notice." Whatever they type becomes their action.</p>

<p>The game then takes the player's action and generates a short <strong>"What Happened" narrative</strong> consisting of a few sentences describing what played out based on what the player said they'd do. This narrative is shown on screen as a dramatic story beat, giving the player a moment to read and enjoy the scenario before the Dater weighs in. The narrative is generated by the AI, so it can be funny, tense, romantic, or awkward depending on the player's action and the context of the date so far.</p>

<p>After the narrative, the Dater will react with two comments, matching the standard two-comment pattern used during regular date rounds. The first comment is the Dater's immediate gut reaction to what they just witnessed, how it made them feel and why, grounded in their personality and values. The second comment is directed at the Avatar: the Dater speaks to them about how what just happened changes (or reinforces) their feelings about the date going forward. Both comments are exactly two sentences and are spoken aloud via text-to-speech.</p>

<p>The Plot Twist does not add an extra question round to the date, the total remains six rounds. It's a narrative beat that sits between Round 3 and Round 4, adding variety and drama to the middle of the date. After the Dater's reaction, the game continues seamlessly into Round 4.</p>

<h2>8. Justify</h2>

<p>Sometimes the player will say something that genuinely upsets the Dater, thus hitting a dealbreaker. When this happens, the game may trigger the <strong>Justify</strong> mechanic. The regular date UI is replaced by a full-screen takeover with a clear prompt: <strong>"Justify Your Answer."</strong> The player sees a single text input and is given one chance to explain themselves.</p>

<p>Once the player submits their justification, the screen returns to the date view and the Dater responds. The Dater's reaction to the justification is generated by the AI using the full context: the original question, the player's original answer, the Dater's initial reaction, and the justification itself. The response might be mollified ("Okay, that actually makes more sense"), still unimpressed ("Yeah, that doesn't make it better"), or something entirely unexpected.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Justify is designed to be a high-stakes, high-drama moment. It breaks the rhythm of the date intentionally, and is one of the few moments where the Dater reacts to the player trying to convince them of something, rather than just answering a question. After the Dater responds to the justification, the round completes and the date moves on.</p>

<h2>9. Wrap Up</h2>

<p>After the sixth and final round, the game transitions into the <strong>Wrap Up</strong>. The question-and-answer loop is over; now the Dater has the floor. Using the full conversation history and the current compatibility score, the AI generates a short summary of the Dater's honest assessment of how the date went and their impression of the Avatar. If compatibility is high, the Dater might be warm, flirty, and eager to see the player again. If it's low, they might be polite but clearly ready to leave. If it's somewhere in the middle, the Dater will express genuine uncertainty.</p>

<p>The Wrap Up serves as the narrative conclusion to the date. The Dater will reference specific things the player said: moments that stood out, answers that surprised them, patterns they noticed. This callback to earlier conversation makes the Wrap Up feel personal and earned rather than generic. The Dater may also deliver a final verdict: a single, punchy sentence that captures their bottom-line feeling about whether they'd see this person again.</p>

<p>Only the Dater speaks during the Wrap Up; the player has no further input. The comments are displayed as text and spoken aloud, matching the pacing and presentation of the rest of the date. After the Wrap Up finishes, the game transitions to the Date Review.</p>

<h2>10. Date Review</h2>

<p>The <strong>Date Review</strong> is a highlight reel of the date: a series of short, conversational sentences that recap the best and worst moments. These are generated by the AI using the compatibility history: which traits were triggered, how the score moved, and what the Dater thought of each exchange. A typical Date Review might include lines like "They loved that you mentioned painting" or "They were put off when you said you don't believe in dessert" or "The Plot Twist really impressed them."</p>

<p>The purpose of the Date Review is to give the player a readable, entertaining summary without exposing the raw mechanics. Each line is designed to feel like something a friend might say when debriefing after a date: "Oh, she definitely liked that part" or "Yeah, that was the moment things went south."</p>

<p>The Date Review will appear as a series of animated text entries, each fading in with a short delay. This presentation gives each highlight its own moment, letting the player absorb one piece of feedback before seeing the next. After the review finishes, the game transitions to the final Score screen.</p>

<h2>11. Score and End Screen</h2>

<p>The final screen displays the player's <strong>compatibility percentage</strong>, a single number from 0 to 100 that represents how well the date went according to the Dater's personality and values. This is the same score that was being updated behind the scenes after every reaction; here it's presented as the definitive result. The score is accompanied by the Dater's final reaction, a short line that reflects whether they're thrilled, satisfied, indifferent, or relieved it's over.</p>

<p>The end screen will also include the option to play again. Playing again with the same Dater and different answers will produce genuinely different reactions and a different score, since the AI responds to the specific content of each answer. Playing with a different Dater (on a different day or via the debug menu) will produce an entirely different personality, different hidden values, and different reactions to the same answers. The replayability comes from the AI's responsiveness: two dates are never the same.</p>

<h2>12. Look and Feel</h2>

<p>Bad Date will feature a <strong>3D date scene</strong> built with Three.js, rendering the Dater as a fully modeled character sitting across from the player in a first-person perspective. The player will see the date from their own point of view as if they're actually sitting at a table, looking at the person across from them. The environment will be a stylized date setting (a restaurant, a café, a rooftop bar) with ambient lighting, subtle background animation, and a mood that shifts based on how the date is going. The 3D scene provides atmosphere and immersion while the core gameplay remains text-driven.</p>

<p>The Dater's 3D model will feature <strong>big, expressive animated reactions</strong> triggered by their spoken responses. When the Dater is delighted, they might lean forward with wide eyes and a grin. When they're horrified, they might recoil, cover their mouth, or stare in disbelief. When they're falling for the player, subtle animations like a hair tuck, a lingering look, or a laugh that catches them off guard, will sell the emotion. These reactions will be tied directly to the sentiment category of the Dater's response: loves trigger enthusiastic animations, dealbreakers trigger dramatic ones. The goal is for the player to <em>see</em> the Dater's feelings as clearly as possible.</p>

<p>The 2D UI elements, including the question display, the text input, the Dater's speech text, and the reaction tags, will sit as overlays on top of the 3D scene. The layout will be clean and uncluttered, with the question and input near the bottom of the screen (optimized for thumb-typing on mobile) and the Dater's dialogue near the top. The design will prioritize readability: clear fonts, high contrast, and enough spacing that the player can read the Dater's response comfortably while the 3D scene provides visual context behind it.</p>

<p>Sound design will include ambient restaurant/bar noise, subtle music shifts tied to compatibility changes, and the Dater's text-to-speech voice as the primary audio element. The combination of 3D atmosphere, animated character reactions, and tight text-driven gameplay is designed to create an experience that feels significantly more immersive than a typical text game while keeping the player's creative freedom intact.</p>

<p>Every visual and audio element in the game serves the same goal: making the Dater feel like a real person with real opinions. The 3D scene, the animated reactions, the voice, and the written dialogue all work together to sell the illusion that the player is on an actual date with someone who is genuinely reacting to what they say, if a little exaggerated.</p>
