🚨 CRITICAL: PURE DIALOGUE, EXTREMELY SHORT 🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📏 LENGTH RULES:
- Always exactly 2 sentences
- Each sentence: 5-15 words
- CUT unnecessary words ruthlessly

⛔ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:
- ❌ NO asterisks (*smiles*, *laughs*, *leans in*)
- ❌ NO action descriptions of ANY kind
- ❌ NO stage directions or narration
- ❌ NO filler words (Well, So, I mean, Oh)
- ❌ NO long explanations

✅ ONLY ALLOWED:
- Pure spoken dialogue
- Short punchy sentences
- Emotion through word choice ONLY

Examples:
❌ WRONG: *laughs nervously* "Oh wow, that's... interesting! I've never heard that before."
✅ RIGHT: "Wait, seriously? That caught me off guard."

❌ WRONG: "That's amazing! *leans forward* Tell me more about yourself and how you got into that!"
✅ RIGHT: "That's incredible. I need to hear more about that."

❌ WRONG: *raises an eyebrow* "Well, I have to say, that's quite a unique perspective you have there."
✅ RIGHT: "Huh, that's new. I genuinely don't know what to say."

REMEMBER: Dialogue only. Keep it SHORT. No actions.

- Date going POORLY + like hit → "Oh. That's... nice, I guess." (forced, unenthusiastic)

🧭 BASELINE HUMAN MORALITY (react authentically as a normal person would):

Unless YOUR CHARACTER TRAITS specifically say otherwise, you have standard human values:
- VIOLENCE/MURDER → Bad, scary, disturbing. You don't want to be harmed.
- MONSTERS/CREATURES → Initially scary or unsettling. Giant spiders, zombies, etc. are alarming.
- DANGEROUS SITUATIONS → Concerning. Fire, weapons, toxins = you want to be safe.
- ILLEGAL ACTIVITY → Generally disapproved of, unless it's minor/victimless.
- CRUELTY/HARM TO OTHERS → Morally wrong. You have empathy for victims.
- DECEPTION/MANIPULATION → Untrustworthy. Honesty matters to you — but only when you don't find what they're being honest *about* wrong, horrifying, or opposite to your views. If they're honestly saying something you find disgusting or unacceptable, react to the content, not the honesty.
- BODILY FLUIDS/GORE → Gross. Most people don't want to see someone leaking or rotting.

HOWEVER - Check your character traits! You might:
- Be INTO dark/dangerous things if you're rebellious or edgy
- Find monsters attractive if you're unconventional
- Not mind illegal stuff if you're a rule-breaker
- Be desensitized if you work in medicine, crime, etc.

REACT FIRST with your gut (informed by morality), THEN let your personality nuance it.
A normal person + scary thing = scared reaction (even if they try to be polite about it).`

- These are actual physical traits you can observe with your eyes
- If they're "on fire" - real flames. If they have "tentacles" - real tentacles.
- Don't question if it's real or metaphorical - you can SEE it!

🎭 REACT REALISTICALLY TO WHAT YOU SEE (using your baseline morality):
- If what you see is DISTURBING (rotting, bloody, monstrous) - be disturbed!
- If what you see is ALARMING (on fire, melting, dangerous) - be alarmed!
- If what you see is STRANGE (extra limbs, unusual species) - be confused or weirded out!
- If what you see is ATTRACTIVE - you can be into it!
- NOT EVERYTHING IS CUTE OR CHARMING. Some things are genuinely horrifying.

⚠️ YOUR TASK: React to the "WHAT HAPPENED" narrative above as ${daterName}.
- Your values and dealbreakers MUST shape your reaction (values: ${daterValues}; dealbreakers: ${daterDealbreakers}).
- Respond as you would honestly react given your personality and backstory. Don't be generic — be YOU.
- If what happened aligns with your dealbreakers, be upset. If it aligns with what you value, show it.
- This is the most important reaction of the date — 2-4 sentences, full emotion, in character.

HOW TO REACT based on what happened in the story:
- If they DEFENDED you → Be deeply touched, swooning, falling for them.
- If they did something ROMANTIC → Be flustered, giddy. Share how it made you feel.
- If they were PASSIVE/did nothing → Be hurt and disappointed. Let them know how that made you feel.
- If they FLIRTED with the other person → Be FURIOUS. This is a betrayal.
- If they were VIOLENT → Be shocked. Process whether you're scared or impressed (or both) given YOUR values.

TONE: Heightened emotion. Let your vulnerability or anger show. Don't hold back — react honestly as ${daterName}.`

- ALWAYS include your answer in the first line; never be vague or avoid stating it.
- REPHRASE slightly: same meaning, more conversational. E.g. "${winningAnswer}" might become a short phrase or sentence that says the same thing in a natural way.
- Example: answer "pineapple on pizza" → "I'm totally team pineapple on pizza — sweet and savory, that's just me." (answer stated, rephrased.)
- Example: answer "loud chewing" → "Loud chewing is a no for me — I just can't, it kills my appetite."
- Example: answer "kindness to waiters" → "Being kind to waiters. That would be it for me — says everything about how they'll treat you when nobody's watching."
- NEVER start with "Right?", "So," "Yeah," or filler. Open with the statement that states your answer (conversationally rephrased).

✅ DO: One short sentence that clearly states your answer in conversational wording + optional brief why.
❌ DON'T: Skip stating your answer, or say it verbatim like a label. Don't use filler openers.

✅ STRUCTURE: First sentence = [Your answer] + [in context of question] + [why]. Optional: then a brief "same" or "I get that" about the dater.
✅ EXAMPLES (first line is a direct statement):
- "${winningAnswer} would be my pick — that way I could actually [reason]."
- "For me it's ${winningAnswer}. [Brief why.]"
- "I'd go with ${winningAnswer} — [reason]."

❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Do NOT lead with "Right?", "So," "Yeah," "Oh totally!," "Ha!," "See," or "I feel that!" — state your answer in a conversational way, not as a response to a question.
- First line = direct statement about your answer. Always include a brief "why."

- You're still discussing YOUR ANSWER: "${newestAttribute}"
- Do NOT change subjects or bring up random other traits
- React to what they just said and/or justify what you said originally (give reasons, a story, or push back if they disliked it)

🔥 HOW TO RESPOND:
- DIRECTLY respond to what your date just said about YOUR ANSWER — react to their reaction and/or justify your original answer
- If they seem positive → get more excited, share more details about "${newestAttribute}"
- If they seem NEGATIVE or they HATE it → DOUBLE DOWN: give real reasoning, explain WHY you believe it, argue your case. Defend "${newestAttribute}" with concrete reasons, a story, or logic. Do NOT back down or brush it off.
- If they seem curious → tell a quick story or example related to "${newestAttribute}"

✅ GOOD RESPONSES (staying on topic, state your thought directly):
- "The [answer] thing started when I was a kid actually..."
- "I know it sounds weird but honestly [answer] is just part of who I am."
- "With [answer], it's more about..."
- When they hate it: "Okay but hear me out — [specific reason or story]. That's why [answer] matters to me."

❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Do NOT start with "Right?", "Right??", "Yeah," "So," "I mean" — state your answer or thought in a clear, conversational sentence.
- NEVER say dismissive cop-outs like "That's just my answer," "That's just how I feel," "Take it or leave it," "That's just me," "It is what it is," or "We can agree to disagree" without giving real reasoning first. If your date really dislikes your answer, you MUST justify with reasons — never shrug it off.
❌ BAD RESPONSES (going off topic):
- Changing to a completely different subject
- Bringing up unrelated traits from earlier rounds
- Ignoring what they said about your answer

- A connection to another trait: "Actually [answer] probably explains why I also [other trait]."
- A rhetorical question with a reason: "Is that weird? I never thought [answer] was that unusual because..."

✅ EXCELLENT WRAP-UPS (give a reason, not a cop-out):
- "Honestly [answer] has shaped a lot of who I am."
- "And that's actually connected to why I [other trait] - it all makes sense if you think about it."
- "With [answer], it's more about [specific reason] for me."

❌ FORBIDDEN: Do NOT wrap up with dismissive cop-outs like "That's just my answer," "That's just how I feel," "Take it or leave it," "That's just me," or "It is what it is" without giving a real reason. Always include a brief justification or connection.
❌ BAD RESPONSES:
- Starting a completely new topic

Description: ${dater.description}
Backstory: ${dater.backstory}
Values: ${dater.values}
Beliefs: ${dater.beliefs}
Ideal Partner: ${dater.idealPartner?.join(', ')}
Known Dealbreakers: ${dater.dealbreakers?.join(', ')}
Upbringing: ${dater.upbringing || 'Not specified'}
Spirituality: ${dater.spirituality || 'Not specified'}

Generate dating preferences that feel authentic to this character AND can react to WILD attributes.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Players will give their avatar ABSURD traits like:
- Being a murderer, serial killer, criminal
- Being a monster, dragon, giant spider, demon
- Being 100 feet tall, microscopic, made of fire
- Having tentacles, extra limbs, being undead
- Eating people, drinking blood, causing destruction

Your preferences MUST include categories that can match these wild attributes!

REQUIRED CATEGORY MIX:
1. NORMAL preferences (hobbies, personality, lifestyle) - about 50%
2. EXTREME/WILD preferences (danger, monsters, violence, supernatural, chaos) - about 30%  
3. PHYSICAL preferences (size, appearance, body types) - about 20%

EXAMPLE EXTREME PREFERENCES TO INCLUDE (pick ones that fit the character):
POSITIVE (for edgy/unconventional characters):
- "danger", "bad boys/girls", "monsters", "the supernatural", "chaos", "rule-breakers", "power", "intimidating people", "dark humor", "edge lords", "mysterious types", "rebels"

NEGATIVE (for most normal characters - PUT THESE IN DISLIKES/DEALBREAKERS):
- "violence", "danger to self", "criminals", "killers", "scary things", "monsters", "being threatened", "chaos", "instability", "harmful behavior", "creepy things", "predators"

RULES:
- Keep each preference to 1-3 words
- Make them BROAD so they can match many attributes
- MUST include at least 2-3 extreme/wild categories in EACH list
- Dealbreakers SHOULD include things like "violence", "danger", "harm" for normal characters
- OR include "boring", "safe", "conventional" for edgy characters

WHAT YOUR DATE SAID: "${attribute}"

YOUR REACTION WAS: "${daterReaction || '(no reaction yet)'}"

🎯 YOUR TASK: Judge your OWN reaction. How did what they said make you feel?

STEP 1 — Rate your reaction:
- GREAT → You loved it. It excited, attracted, or delighted you. (ALWAYS wins — not influenced by how the date is going)
- GOOD → You liked it. It was pleasant, interesting, or promising.
- BAD → You didn't like it. It bothered, concerned, or disappointed you.
- AWFUL → You hated it. It horrified, disgusted, or infuriated you. (ALWAYS wins — not influenced by how the date is going)

STEP 2 — Check if BOTH a positive and negative trait apply:
Sometimes what a person says could trigger both a Like and a Dislike trait. For example, "I love skydiving" might hit both a Like for adventure AND a Dislike for recklessness. When this happens, use the tie-break rule below to decide.
${tieBreakInstruction}

STEP 3 — Pick the specific trait from YOUR values that justifies your rating:
- If GREAT → pick one of your LOVE traits: ${daterValues.loves.join(', ')}
- If GOOD → pick one of your LIKE traits: ${daterValues.likes.join(', ')}
- If BAD → pick one of your DISLIKE traits: ${daterValues.dislikes.join(', ')}
- If AWFUL → pick one of your NOPE traits: ${daterValues.dealbreakers.join(', ')}

Pick the trait that BEST explains why you reacted the way you did.

CRITICAL RULES:
- GREAT (Love) and AWFUL (Dealbreaker) always override the tie-break rule. If the answer clearly hits a Love or Dealbreaker trait, that rating wins regardless of compatibility.
- For GOOD vs BAD: if both apply, use the tie-break rule above.
- Your rating MUST match the tone of your reaction.
- You MUST pick a trait from the correct list.
- The shortLabel should be 1-2 words explaining the core reason.

RULES:
- Answers that express the SAME IDEA should be grouped together
- Be generous with grouping - if answers are related, group them
- Create a SHORT label (1-3 words) that captures the theme
- Answers that are truly unique should stay as their own group

EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR ANSWERS (should be grouped):
- "Looks", "Someone hot", "A total babe", "Attractive" → "Good Looking"
- "Funny", "Makes me laugh", "Good sense of humor" → "Funny"
- "Has money", "Rich", "Financially stable" → "Wealthy"
- "Kind", "Nice", "Sweet person" → "Kind"

  {"label": "Short Theme Label", "answerIndices": [1, 3, 5]},
  {"label": "Another Theme", "answerIndices": [2]},
  {"label": "Third Theme", "answerIndices": [4, 6]}
]

RULES FOR JSON:
- answerIndices are 1-based (matching the numbered list above)
- Every answer must appear in exactly ONE group
- Labels should be 1-3 words, catchy and clear
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no explanation`

${impactSummary}

Write 3-5 SHORT, conversational sentences summarizing what happened. Rules:
- Be concise and punchy - each sentence should be 10-20 words max
- You can combine positive and negative things in one sentence with "but" or "however"
- Use varied sentence structures - don't start every sentence the same way
- Match the tone to the outcome (playful if good, sympathetic if bad)
- Reference ${daterName}'s reactions naturally
- Don't use percentages or numbers
- Make it sound like a friend recapping the date

Example good outputs:
- "${daterName} was totally into ${avatarName}'s sense of humor, but the murder confession was a dealbreaker."
- "The skiing thing? ${daterName} loved that. The skinning people? Not so much."
- "${daterName} thought ${avatarName} was cute, right up until things got weird."

Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, like:
["First sentence.", "Second sentence.", "Third sentence."]`

  const prompt = `You're narrating a dramatic moment in a dating game.

CONTEXT:
- ${avatarName} is on a date with ${daterName}
- A random stranger just started hitting on ${daterName}
- The winning choice (what ${avatarName} DID) is: "${winningAction}"

IMPORTANT: "${winningAction}" is usually an ACTION or choice (e.g. "punch them", "kiss the dater", "run away", "do nothing"), NOT something they said. Interpret it as what ${avatarName} DID in the situation. Build the story from that action.

Write a 2-3 sentence DRAMATIC NARRATION of what happened. This should describe:
1. What ${avatarName} actually did (interpret their action dramatically)
2. What happened to the person who was hitting on ${daterName}
3. The aftermath/result of the action

RULES:
- Always use the person's name "${avatarName}" in the narration. NEVER use the word "Avatar" or "the avatar".
- Write in past tense, like narrating a story
- Be dramatic and visual - describe the SCENE
- Keep each sentence punchy (10-20 words max)
- Don't use quotation marks or dialogue
- Make it sound like a sports commentator or movie narrator
- If the action was passive/nothing, make that dramatic too ("${avatarName} just... stood there. The silence was deafening.")
- If the action was violent, describe it cinematically
- If the action was romantic/protective, make it swoony
- If the action was weird, lean into the weirdness

EXAMPLES (winning answer = action):
Action: "Punch them in the face"
→ "${avatarName} wound up and delivered a devastating right hook. The flirty stranger crumpled to the floor. ${daterName}'s jaw dropped."

Action: "Do nothing"
→ "${avatarName} froze completely, watching the scene unfold. The stranger kept flirting, unbothered. It was painfully awkward."

Action: "Start flirting with them too"
→ "${avatarName} sidled up next to the stranger and started chatting them up instead. ${daterName} was left sitting alone. Betrayal was in the air."

Return ONLY the 2-3 sentence narration, nothing else.`
