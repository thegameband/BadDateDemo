# Deploy / Push: Always Bump Build and Report Version

**When the user asks to push the game live, or when you complete a task that will be pushed live:**

1. **Increment the build number** in both places:
   - `package.json` → `"version": "0.02.XX"` (increment the last number)
   - `src/components/LiveLobby.jsx` → `const GAME_VERSION = '0.02.XX'` (same value)

2. **Commit and push** the changes (including the version bump).

3. **Tell the user the new version number** after pushing, e.g.  
   **"Pushed. Version is 0.02.XX."**

Do this **every time** you push the game live, unless the user explicitly says not to bump the version.
