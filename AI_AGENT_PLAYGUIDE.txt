The game has 5 ROUNDS. Each round has 3 PHASES:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: SUGGEST ATTRIBUTES (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The DATER (NPC) asks a question in a speech bubble
- Your AVATAR needs to answer
- TYPE an attribute/trait in the input box (e.g., "is a vampire", "loves murder", "has 3 eyes")
- Press the ✨ button or Enter to submit
- Your suggestion appears for everyone to see
- Other players can also suggest attributes
- The timer starts when the first suggestion is made

WHAT TO SUGGEST:
- Wild, absurd, funny traits work best
- Physical traits: "is 100 feet tall", "has tentacles", "is on fire"
- Personality traits: "is a serial killer", "obsessed with cheese"
- Be creative and chaotic!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: VOTE (15 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All suggested attributes appear as numbered options
- Vote for your favorite by clicking/tapping the number
- The attribute with the most votes wins
- If tied, one is chosen randomly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: WATCH THE CONVERSATION (automatic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The winning attribute is applied to the AVATAR
- The AVATAR responds using that trait
- The DATER reacts (positively or negatively)
- The compatibility meter updates based on the dater's reaction
- After the exchange, a new round begins
