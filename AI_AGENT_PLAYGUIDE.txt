2. Click "✨ Create a Date"
3. You'll immediately enter your lobby with:
   - A QR code (for phone players)
   - Player count showing "1/20"
   - Options for "Show Tutorial" and "Starting Stats" checkboxes
4. Your room is now visible to all players in the "Join a Date" browser

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IF YOU ARE JOINING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Enter your name in the text field
2. Click "🔗 Join a Date"
3. You'll see a ROOM BROWSER showing all available rooms
4. Each room shows:
   - Host's name (e.g., "Player123's Room")
   - Which dater they're dating (e.g., "Dating: Kickflip")
   - Player count (e.g., "2/20")
5. Click on any room to join it
6. Wait in the lobby for the host to start

NOTE: Rooms automatically disappear from the browser when:
- The game starts (no longer in lobby phase)
- The game ends

================================================================================
STEP 2: STARTING STATS (Optional - Default ON)
================================================================================

If "Starting Stats" mode is enabled, before the date begins:

1. PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES (3 questions)
   - 3 random players are asked: "What physical attribute would you like your date to have?"
   - Each player has 15 seconds to type an answer
   - All players see who is answering and what they submit
   - Examples: "has 8 arms", "is made of cheese", "glows in the dark"

2. EMOTIONAL STATE (2 questions)
   - 2 random players are asked: "What emotional state is your date in?"
   - Same 15-second timer per player
   - Examples: "anxious and sweaty", "overconfident", "secretly terrified"

3. NAMING THE DATE (1 question)
   - 1 random player is asked: "What should we name your date?"
   - Example: "Bartholomew", "Xena the Destroyer", "Greg"

After all questions:
- The Avatar gets all the submitted attributes
- The Dater sees the Avatar for the first time and REACTS
- The Avatar responds, influenced by their emotional state
- Then Round 1 begins

NOTE: If there are fewer than 6 players, the same players may answer multiple questions (but never the same question TYPE twice).

================================================================================
STEP 3: THE DATE (GAMEPLAY)
================================================================================

The game has 5 ROUNDS. Each round has 3 PHASES:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 1: SUGGEST ATTRIBUTES (30 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The DATER (NPC) asks a question in a speech bubble
- Your AVATAR needs to answer
- TYPE an attribute/trait in the input box (e.g., "is a vampire", "loves murder", "has 3 eyes")
- Press the ✨ button or Enter to submit
- Your suggestion appears for everyone to see
- Other players can also suggest attributes
- Timer starts immediately when the phase begins

WHAT TO SUGGEST:
- Wild, absurd, funny traits work best
- Physical traits: "is 100 feet tall", "has tentacles", "is on fire"
- Personality traits: "is a serial killer", "obsessed with cheese"
- Be creative and chaotic!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2: VOTE (15 seconds)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All suggested attributes appear as numbered options
- Vote for your favorite by clicking/tapping the number
- The attribute with the most votes wins
- If tied, one is chosen randomly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 3: WATCH THE CONVERSATION (automatic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The winning attribute is applied to the AVATAR
- The AVATAR responds using that trait
- The DATER reacts (positively or negatively)
- The compatibility meter updates based on the dater's reaction
- After the exchange, a new round begins

================================================================================
STEP 4: RESULTS (AFTER 5 ROUNDS)
================================================================================

After 5 rounds, the date ends and you see:
- Final compatibility percentage
- What the Dater loved/liked/disliked about your Avatar
- The complete Avatar with all attributes
- Option to play again
